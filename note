If you're opting to provide specific primitive functions for strings, focusing on the most common and useful operations would be a good approach. Here's a suggested set of string-specific primitives:

1. **Length**: Return the number of characters in a string.
   ```lisp
   (string-length "hello") ; => 5
   ```

2. **Substring**: Extract a substring from a string given a start and optionally an end index.
   ```lisp
   (substring "hello" 1 3) ; => "el"
   ```

3. **Character At**: Get the character at a specific index in a string.
   ```lisp
   (string-char-at "hello" 1) ; => "e"
   ```

4. **String Equality**: Check if two strings are equal.
   ```lisp
   (string-equal? "hello" "hello") ; => true
   ```

5. **String Append**: Concatenate multiple strings. (You have this as `concat`).
   ```lisp
   (string-append "hel" "lo") ; => "hello"
   ```

6. **String Search**: Find a substring within a string, returning its start index or some indication of failure if not found.
   ```lisp
   (string-search "hello" "ell") ; => 1
   ```

7. **String Replace**: Replace occurrences of a substring with another string.
   ```lisp
   (string-replace "hello" "ell" "ipp") ; => "hippo"
   ```

8. **String Case Manipulations**:
   - Convert to uppercase.
   - Convert to lowercase.
   ```lisp
   (string-upper "hello") ; => "HELLO"
   (string-lower "HELLO") ; => "hello"
   ```

9. **String Trim**: Remove leading and trailing whitespaces.
   ```lisp
   (string-trim " hello ") ; => "hello"
   ```

10. **String Split**: Split a string by a delimiter into a list of strings.
    ```lisp
    (string-split "a,b,c" ",") ; => ("a" "b" "c")
    ```

11. **String Join**: Join a list of strings using a delimiter.
    ```lisp
    (string-join '("a" "b" "c") ",") ; => "a,b,c"
    ```

These are some of the fundamental string operations that would be helpful in many contexts. Of course, based on the specific use-cases of your Lisp interpreter and its users, you might want to add or omit some of these operations. But having a solid foundation like this should cover most general string manipulation needs.
