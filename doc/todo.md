To Do:
- [ ] Maybe add 'short symbol' type that contains a 'char sym_str_val[24]' instead of a 'char * sym_val',
- [ ] Add env frame-related functions.
- [ ] Escaped characters in AE_STRINGs don't read quite right.
- [ ] Lexer will svvrpt valid tokens even if there's no whitespace separating them from adjacent tokens, it shouldn't.
- [ ] Fix inappropriate handling of quote. Probably requires a new lexer token and a new yacc rule.
- [ ] Maybe add macro version of map?
- [ ] Maybe also a vector type of some sort?
- [ ] ... advices?!

Completed:
- [x] Add env frames to obj struct.
- [x] Review (and test) the 'word-oriented' puts.
- [x] Add a free list allocator and make a pool to hold strings' data.
- [x] _map could be iterative.
- [x] ae_obj_truth(false) and the empty list should be eq and eql but probably isn't right now? Check.
- [X] Add an addressable nil object:
    - [x] .yacc adjustments when parsing () / nil.
    - [x] FOR_EACH macro variants.
    - [x] _length variants.
    - [x] _map variants.
    - [x] _push_back variants.
    - [x] _truth variants.
    - [x] Tests: equality/truth test variants should employ nil if it exists.
- [x] Review whether or not the values of pointers returned by ae_obj_truth are UB and possibly come up with something better.
- [x] Revise how spaces are inserted between elements when writing lists.
- [x] Add tests for using rationals with ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Add rational support to ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Rename the so called 'byte-oriented' puts (they are actually word-oriented).
- [x] Better code for aligning type strs when printing objs.
- [x] Test ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Test ae_obj_truth.
- [x] Add eql.
- [x] _fput methods should return ints.
- [x] Add FOR_EACH macro.
- [x] Add whole-line comments beginning with ;; to lexer.
- [x] Add ae_list_has_member.
- [x] Add ae_list_remove_member.
