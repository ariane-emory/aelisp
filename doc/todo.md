To Do:
- [ ] load: should accept strings (not just symbols) and should not add file extension.
- [ ] require: add :no-error and :force arguments.
- [ ] require: when feature?, only reload if :force.
- [ ] revise startup to (provide :stdblib).
- [ ] *program* entries by symbol instead of name. Maybe move entirely into *features* as properties or plist items?
- [ ] makunbound.
- [ ] Refactor: CORE_RETURN should be unary.
- [ ] Special variables should skip local lookup for set/get.
- [ ] AE_FILE type.
- [ ] Review correctness environments used for macro expansion/evaluation.
- [ ] Review correctness of unwinding indentation.
- [ ] try incremental bubble sorting env syms/vals?
- [ ] Escaped characters in AE_STRINGs don't read quite right, will need code similar to AE_CHARs.
- [ ] Review printing of characters that need escaping.
- [ ] Implement math for non-integer types.
- [ ] Lexer will accept otherwise-valid tokens even if there's no whitespace separating them from adjacent non-paren tokens, it should not.
- [ ] fprinc_lengths test passes normally but fails when run in lldb? Investigate.
- [ ] GC.

Under Consideration:
- [ ] core_concat could be simplified using strcat? Maybe not.
- [ ] eval could take an optional env param?
- [ ] Set metadata bit for delocalized state. (Set it when, exactly? What did I mean when I added this?)
- [ ] Maybe parse-time math on integers?
- [ ] Maybe put line/column of source in properties of read objects?
- [ ] Maybe slice up root_env_and_eval test? It's pretty big.
- [ ] Maybe eliminate use of memstreams in swrite/sput/sprinc?
- [ ] Maybe add a 'short symbol' ae_type that contains a 'char sym_str_val[24]' instead of a 'char * sym_val',
- [ ] Maybe also a vector type of some sort?
- [ ] Maybe add macro version of map? May not need it.
- [ ] ... advices?!

- [x] core setq! should return an error if asked to set the value of nil, t or keywords.

- [x] core env should be able to take an optional fun argument.
- [x] core funs should probably have an env as a param too.
- [x] maybe ERROR should be a type?
- [x] user fun args always prints as nil? (No, they don't).
- [x] (list 1 2 . 333) isn't the same as (quote (1 2 . 333))? should it be? (answer: no)

- [x] Maybe add 'print' (just 'write' with a newline in front).
- [x] Test macro expansion.
- [x] Implement macro expansion.
- [x] Dotted pairs. 
- [x] DRY up princ and print.

    - [x] _length variants.
    - [x] _map variants.

- [x] Add tests for using rationals with ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Add rational support to ae_obj_eql.
