To Do:
- [ ] plist_set should do a mutate/new tail swap instead of consing.
- [ ] core plist-set! should be special and only accept symbols or non-empty lists.
- [ ] core_put_prop shouldn't allow putting properties on some symbols like t or nil, maybe add a :no-user-properties property?
- { } core_alist needs to be revised or maybe removed.
- [ ] Improve butlast to take optional N.
- [ ] Add dotimes, it's just a fancier repeat.
- [ ] Better version of return.
- [ ] Some sort of catch.
- [ ] Maybe let loop?
- [ ] Audit free_list_malloc/free.
- [ ] makunbound.
- [ ] AE_FILE type.
- [ ] Refactor: CORE_RETURN should be unary.
- [ ] DRY up core_funs.c.
- [ ] DRY up core_let.c.
- [ ] Review correctness environments used for macro expansion/evaluation, especially for nested macros.
- [ ] Review correctness of unwinding indentation.
- [ ] try incremental selection sorting env syms/vals?
- [ ] Escaped characters in AE_STRINGs don't read quite right, will need code similar to AE_CHARs.
- [ ] Review printing of characters that need escaping.
- [ ] Implement math for non-integer types.
- [ ] Lexer will accept otherwise-valid tokens even if there's no whitespace separating them from adjacent non-paren tokens, it should not.
- [ ] fprinc_lengths test passes normally but fails when run in lldb? Investigate.
- [ ] read-only property isn't well thought out.
- [ ] GC.

Under Consideration:
- [ ] Maybe move load_file?
- [ ] Maybe pretty-print s-exps?
- [ ] core_concat could be simplified using strcat? Maybe not.
- [ ] eval could take an optional env param?
- [ ] Set metadata bit for delocalized state. (Set it when, exactly? What did I mean when I added this?)
- [ ] Maybe parse-time math on integers?
- [ ] Maybe put line/column of source in properties of read objects?
- [ ] Maybe slice up root_env_and_eval test? It's pretty big.
- [ ] Maybe eliminate use of memstreams in swrite/sput/sprinc?
- [ ] Maybe add a 'short symbol' ae_type that contains a 'char sym_str_val[24]' instead of a 'char * sym_val',
- [ ] Maybe also a vector type of some sort?
- [ ] Maybe add macro version of map? May not need it.
- [ ] ... advices?!

- [x] core env should be able to take an optional fun argument.
- [x] core funs should probably have an env as a param too.
- [x] maybe ERROR should be a type?
- [x] user fun args always prints as nil? (No, they don't).
