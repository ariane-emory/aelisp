To Do:
- [ ] core setq should return an error if asked to set the value of nil.
- [ ] test to confirm that core setq returns an error if asked to set the value of nil.
- [ ] core setq should return an error if asked to set the value of t.
- [ ] test to confirm that core setq returns an error if asked to set the value of t.
- [ ] core setq should return an error if asked to set the value of a keyword.
- [ ] test to confirm that core setq returns an error if asked to set the value of a keyword.
- [ ] refactor FOR_EACH_CORE_FUN and FOR_EACH_SPECIAL core fun into a single list with more columns for more control over the order of symbols in root env.
- [ ] core apply
- [ ] fix macro expansion from eval.
- [ ] Implement math for non-integer types.
- [ ] Escaped characters in AE_STRINGs don't read quite right, will need code similar to AE_CHARs.
- [ ] Review printing of characters needing escaping.
- [ ] Lexer will accept otherwise-valid tokens even if there's no whitespace separating them from adjacent non-paren tokens, it should not.
- [ ] fprinc_lengths test passes normally but fails when run in lldb? Investigate.

Under Consideration:
- [ ] Maybe slice up root_env_and_eval test? It's pretty big.
- [ ] Maybe core 'let'? Could be a macro, though...
- [ ] Maybe eliminate use of memstreams in swrite/sput/sprinc?
- [ ] Maybe add a 'short symbol' ae_type that contains a 'char sym_str_val[24]' instead of a 'char * sym_val',
- [ ] Maybe FOR_EACH2 macro for parralel lists? Unsure, may not need it.
- [ ] Maybe also a vector type of some sort?
- [ ] Maybe add macro version of map? May not need it.
- [ ] ... advices?!

Completed:
- [x] core_cond is noisy, tidy/quiet it and improve it's logging.
- [x] core rplaca/rplacd
- [x] Improve parsing of sugared quote ('). Probably requires a new lexer token and a new yacc rule.
- [x] core env should be able to take an optional fun argument.
- [x] core env should be able to take an optional fun argument.
- [x] core funs should probably have an env as a param too.
- [x] maybe ERROR should be a type?
- [x] user fun args always prints as nil? (No, they don't).
- [x] (list 1 2 . 333) isn't the same as (quote (1 2 . 333))? should it be? (answer: no)
- [x] Keyword symbols should be self-evaluating.
- [x] Maybe add 'print' (just 'write' with a newline in front).
- [x] Test macro expansion.
- [x] Implement macro expansion.
- [x] Dotted pairs. 
- [x] DRY up princ and print.
- [x] progn's return value appears to be incorrect under tests? (No it wasn't, I was just confused.)
- [x] fwrite_lengths test is noisy.
- [x] Split princ into princ and print.
- [x] Implement eval functions.
- [x] Load the root environment up (added ae_env_new_root).
- [x] Add in-world primitive functions.
- [x] ae_obj_eql could maybe support AE_STRINGs too? Might as well.
- [x] ae_obj_eql should support AE_CHARSs.
- [x] Add env frame-related functions.
- [x] Get rid of strdup call in ae_obj.c.
- [x] Add env frames to obj struct.
- [x] Review (and test) the 'word-oriented' puts.
- [x] Add a free list allocator and make a pool to hold strings' data.
- [x] _map could be iterative.
- [x] ae_obj_truth(false) and the empty list should be eq and eql but probably isn't right now? Check.
- [X] Add an addressable nil object:
    - [x] .yacc adjustments when parsing () / nil.
    - [x] FOR_EACH macro variants.
    - [x] _length variants.
    - [x] _map variants.
    - [x] _push_back variants.
    - [x] _truth variants.
    - [x] Tests: equality/truth test variants should employ nil if it exists.
- [x] Review whether or not the values of pointers returned by ae_obj_truth are UB and possibly come up with something better.
- [x] Revise how spaces are inserted between elements when writing lists.
- [x] Add tests for using rationals with ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Add rational support to ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Rename the so called 'byte-oriented' puts (they are actually word-oriented).
- [x] Better code for aligning type strs when printing objs.
- [x] Test ae_obj_eql.
- [x] Test ae_obj_truth.
- [x] Add eql.
- [x] _fput methods should return ints.
- [x] Add FOR_EACH macro.
- [x] Add whole-line comments beginning with ;; to lexer.
- [x] Add ae_list_has_member.
- [x] Add ae_list_remove_member.

Cancelled:
- [x] certain funcs should NOT return early when given ERRORS arguments. (Early return removed for now)
